# TOLA: Token of Love and Appreciation

## Overview

TOLA (Token of Love and Appreciation) is an innovative gamification framework integrated within the VORTEX AI Marketplace, designed to foster engagement, recognition, and community building in digital art ecosystems. TOLA transforms traditional art market interactions into an engaging ecosystem where contributions, interactions, and achievements are recognized and rewarded.
