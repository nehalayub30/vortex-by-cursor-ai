# TOLA: Token of Love and Appreciation

The TOLA (Token of Love and Appreciation) system is an innovative gamification framework integrated within the VORTEX AI AGENTS plugin, designed to foster engagement, recognition, and community building in the art marketplace.

## Overview

TOLA transforms traditional art market interactions into an engaging ecosystem where contributions, interactions, and achievements are recognized and rewarded. By tokenizing appreciation, TOLA creates tangible incentives for positive participation while providing valuable market signals for artists, collectors, galleries, and investors.

## Core Components

### 1. TOLA Token Economy

TOLA tokens function as a non-monetary value system within the VORTEX ecosystem:
- Tokens are earned through positive contributions and meaningful engagement
- Tokens can be awarded to artists, artworks, galleries, exhibitions, or collectors
- Token accumulation provides reputation and influence within the ecosystem
- Tokens create attention signals that help surface quality and innovation

### 2. Achievement Framework

The achievement system recognizes specific milestones and contributions:

| Achievement Category | Examples |
|---------------------|----------|
| Artist Achievements | First exhibition, Style mastery, Community recognition |
| Collector Achievements | Collection diversity, Early supporter, Tastemaker |
| Gallery Achievements | Talent discovery, Exhibition excellence, Community building |
| Critic Achievements | Insightful analysis, Educational content, Market influence |

### 3. Community Recognition

TOLA enables peer-to-peer appreciation:
- Artists can recognize collectors who support their work
- Collectors can highlight artists creating meaningful work
- Galleries can acknowledge artists and collectors
- Community members can recognize valuable contributions

### 4. Insight Generation

TOLA activity generates valuable market signals:
- Trending artists based on token accumulation
- Emerging talent discovery through early recognition patterns
- Collection value assessment through appreciation metrics
- Community consensus on artistic innovation and quality

## Technical Implementation

### TOLA Service

The core TOLA functionality is implemented in `includes/services/class-tola-service.php`:

```php
class TOLA_Service {
    public function award_tola($recipient_id, $source_id, $amount, $context = '')
    public function get_tola_balance($entity_id)
    public function get_top_recipients($category, $time_period = 'all')
    public function get_achievement_progress($entity_id, $achievement_id)
    public function unlock_achievement($entity_id, $achievement_id)
    private function calculate_level($tola_points)
    private function trigger_achievement_checks($entity_id, $event_type)
}
```

### Integration with WordPress

The TOLA system integrates with WordPress user management and extends it with custom taxonomies and post types:

```php
// Register TOLA token transaction post type
register_post_type('tola_transaction', [
    'public' => false,
    'hierarchical' => false,
    'supports' => ['author', 'custom-fields'],
    'capabilities' => [
        'create_posts' => 'manage_options',
    ],
]);

// Register achievement taxonomy
register_taxonomy('tola_achievement', ['user', 'artwork', 'gallery'], [
    'hierarchical' => true,
    'show_ui' => true,
    'labels' => [
        'name' => __('Achievements', 'vortex-ai-agents'),
        'singular_name' => __('Achievement', 'vortex-ai-agents'),
    ],
]);
```

### Shortcodes for Display

The plugin provides shortcodes for displaying TOLA information:

```php
// Display user's TOLA balance and achievements
[vortex_tola_profile user_id="123"]

// Display leaderboard for a specific category
[vortex_tola_leaderboard category="artists" time_period="monthly" limit="10"]

// Display achievement showcase
[vortex_achievements entity_id="123" layout="grid"]
```

## User Interface Components

### TOLA Profile Widget

The TOLA Profile Widget displays a user's tokens, achievements, and level:

```php
// Initialize TOLA profile widget
$tola_profile = new VortexAIAgents\Widgets\TOLA_Profile_Widget();
$tola_profile->render([
    'user_id' => get_current_user_id(),
    'show_achievements' => true,
    'show_history' => true
]);
```

### TOLA Award Button

The TOLA Award Button allows users to award tokens to others:

```php
// Display TOLA award button for an artwork
$tola_button = new VortexAIAgents\Widgets\TOLA_Award_Button();
$tola_button->render([
    'entity_id' => $artwork_id,
    'entity_type' => 'artwork',
    'award_options' => [1, 3, 5, 10]
]);
```

### Achievement Showcase

The Achievement Showcase displays unlocked and pending achievements:

```php
// Display achievement showcase
$achievement_showcase = new VortexAIAgents\Widgets\Achievement_Showcase();
$achievement_showcase->render([
    'entity_id' => $user_id,
    'layout' => 'carousel',
    'show_locked' => true
